# Continuum_Suppression
In this project, we have applied machine learning techniques to train and predict the outcomes. We have primarily used 3 different type of models i.e, convolutional neural network (CNN), XgBoost and Randomforest.\
To find the optimum hyperparameters for the models, we have applied RandomizedSearchCV techniques. We have also tried dimension reduction using PCA and then evaluated accuracy scores for the dimensionaly reduced data using the same models but with different hyperparameters to compare it with the one without PCA.\
The results are good with accuracy score of around 80%.
